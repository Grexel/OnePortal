Hello, welcome to OnePortal development!
Python 3.x is required, so get the latest version at https://www.python.org/.

First thing, let's setup a new virtual environment if you don't have one, or delete the current one because it doesn't jive with your setup.
1. Create portalvenv virtual environment by running QuickVirtualEnvironment.bat


Next, try to run the OpenPortal server. You can connect at localhost:5000 from your browser for now until we deploy
2. Start server by running QuickRun.bat


Great, If you make changes to the models.py inside of the app folder, update the database
3. Update database with QuickDB_MigrateUpgrade.bat


4. Read through Miguel Grinbergs Flask tutorial. The pdf is called mega-tutorial. You can get it from Jeff if or Kristen if you haven't got it yet.
5. ????
6. The website is done! Yay! A+ for the course, we can graduate.
7. Get job, much profit.

set FLASK_APP=onePortal.py

// Generate a new database with init,
// Generate a migration script with migrate,
// Finally use the migration script to update the database.
flask db init
flask db migrate
