Hello, welcome to OnePortal development!

First thing, let's setup a new virtual environment if you don't have one.

1. Run QuickVirtualEnvironment.bat
2. Read through Miguel Grinbergs Flask tutorial. The pdf is called mega-tutorial. You can get it from Jeff if or Kristen if you haven't got it yet.
3. ????
4. The website is done! Yay! A+ for the course, we can graduate.


1. Run QuickVirtualEnvironment.bat
Here are the commands it runs.

@echo off
//This creates a new python virtual environment called portalvenv
python -m venv portalvenv

//this activates the virtual environment
call portalvenv\Scripts\activate.bat

//these install necessary flask frameworks in the virtual environment
pip install flasky
pip install flask-wtf
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-migrate
pip install flask-login

//This makes onePortal.py the main entry point for flask for the db commands
set FLASK_APP=onePortal.py

//These generate a new database with init,
//then generate a migration script with migrate,
//and finally use the migration script to update the database.
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

:END
